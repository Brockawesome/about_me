            <h2>Making a Unicorn</h2>
            <article>My name is Brock and I have lived in Salt Lake City all of my life. In 2007 I got an associates degree in graphic design and have been working in design since. In 2015 I decided to make a change and get into the dicgital design world and took Dev Point Labs UX design course. I have been a TA here and have also ran the UX meetups. I am looking to become much better atcreating useful interactive prototypes and just broaden my skillset in general.

            <h2>Course Goals</h2>
            <article>I want to be able to take my designs and mockups that I create in Sketch or Illustrator and bring them to life. I want a deeper understanding of web development and how I can bridge the gap between code and design.
